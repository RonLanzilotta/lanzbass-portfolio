# Personal Recording Portfolio

This project is a portfolio for my recording work as a session bass player. The portfolio includes records that I've made with longtime collaborators, singles that I've recorded for hire, and personal lo-fi creative explorations. The archive can be updated via a remote API which I built for this project. This webpage makes calls to the API for its data.
